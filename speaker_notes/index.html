<h3>Slide 1</h3>

<p>
Hi. My name is ..., and I am ....

<p>
These are your notes, write them the way you want.

<p>
Some people write only bullet
points, other people write complete sentences, and others write full sentences
with bold font on the <b>key elements</b> of each sentence.
<p>
That will help avoid perceptible eye movement and reduce the risk of
getting lost while speaking.
<p>
If you go with full sentences, make sure you use small paragraphs, and don't
make blocks bigger than three or four lines. Use html p element to separate
paragraphs.
<p>
Note that this template sets the text blocks to 500px of width, which may also
avoid perceptible eye movement.


<h3>Slide 2</h3>
<p>
Have clear indications on where you are moving from one slide to the other, so
that you can ask whoever is commanding the slides "next slide, please" (or you
do it yourself)


<h3>Demo</h3>

Prefix code with talking notes. It is hard to type and think simultaneously.
<code>
ls ~/here_you_have_your_command && echo "click on this block and it will copy to
your clipboard automatically"
</code>

You can have as many code blocks as possible, just keep them one liners if
possible.
<code>
echo "notice what happens when you click on a block and moves the mouse out of
it"
</code>


<h4>Use subtitles for demo boundaries</h4>

More stuff here
<code>
echo "just kidding, this is useless"
</code>

<p>
<hr>

<p>
<i>Can we switch back to the slides, please?</i>


<h3>Slide 3</h3>

<p>
Nothing new here, but notice the empty space below.

<p>
It is set by CSS, and it allows you to scroll til the end, so that
your eyes don't need to look down.

<p>
Remember to keep eye contact with the camera as much as possible.
